Unzip the attached folder.

Into the extracted folder(FCN_tensorflow) create

Folders:

1)annotations/training
2)annotations/validation
3)images/training
4)images/validation

Then copy the images from ECTIS Database into the corresponding folders. I split the 196 images into 120 for training and 76 for validation.

Then run the code. FCN.py. The VGG weights would be downloaded and then the images would be compressed to 224 by 224 automatically and then it would perform the training.
